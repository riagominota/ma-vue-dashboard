        This tab provides controls for editing the properties of a point.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can specify a <strong>Unit</strong> for a point. Type in the symbol for the unit e.g. kg, L, mA, Hz, lb.
    Note that for some units there are multiple ways of entering the unit, e.g. for degrees celsius you can enter
    &deg;C or
    Celsius, for ohms you can use &Omega; or Ohm. Also remember that there are sometimes multiple definitions of a
    unit, e.g. there are metric tonnes (t),
    short tons (ton_us) and long tons (ton_uk). You can use all SI prefixes on SI units, e.g. you can enter W for watt
    and also &micro;W (microwatt), MW (megawatt) etc.</p>
    
    <p>
    <br>
    For SI Units see the list here <a href='http://jscience.org/api/javax/measure/unit/SI.html' target='blank'>here</a>.
    <br>
    For NonSI Units see the list <a href='http://jscience.org/api/javax/measure/unit/NonSI.html' target='blank'>here</a>.
    <br>
    Note that there are also some units internally defined in this system:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>btu - British thermal unit</li>
        <li>thm - Thermal Unit (BTU * 100000)</li>
        <li>psi - Pounds per square inch</li>
        <li>rpm - Revolutions per minute</li>
        <li>ppm - Part per million</li>
        <li>ppb - Part per billion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are also some aliases for common units defined here:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Celsius - &deg;C</li>
        <li>Fahrenheit - &deg;F</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Units can also be constructed as an expression of units, such as expressing the units of acceleration m/s^2 or
        a
        unit of
        surface loss m^2/s. Kilowatt hours is special: while kW*h would be the means of building it, <strong>kWh</strong> is the
        standard suffix
        and both are supported units. Similarly, gal/min is more simply labeled <strong>gpm</strong> in common practice, and both
        are
        accepted units.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Displayed unit</strong> specifies which unit the renderer should convert to for display (if supported by the
        renderer).
        Input format is the same as for Unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Integral unit</strong> used in the display of statistic and specifies which unit the integrated total should
        be
        displayed in. Input format is the same as for Unit.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Chart color</strong> is the default color of the point's line in images charts of multiple points. Color
        values
        can be an HTML-style hex, or any color name in the HTML specification. For example, "#2468AC", "red", and
        "dodgerblue" are all valid values.
    </p>
    <p>
            The <strong>Plot type</strong> is the default way the data will be represented on a chart.  
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Line: </strong> Will draw a direct line between each point useing the shortest possible route.</li>
        <li><strong>Smooth: </strong> Will apply a smoothing algorithm when drawings the line between each point on the chart.</li>
        <li><strong>Step: </strong> Will connect each point on the chart by only useing 90 degree angles.</li>
        <li><strong>Bar: </strong> Will draw a column for each data point on the cart.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The point can influence its default charting through a <strong>Rollup</strong> which will plot that statistical metric
        when
        a rollup of 'Point default' is requested. A rollup has a <strong>Rollup period</strong> and a <strong>Rollup period type</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both rollups and raw data sets can also be put through the Simplify algorithm. Data sets can aspire to have a
        certain resulting
        number of values, or provide a magnitude for what is significant. While this can take more resources and time
        to
        get the data set, the data set should have its minor variances simplified. A point set to simplify either to a
        target or a
        tolerance it will use the <strong>Simplify argument</strong> for that value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data points can restrict outgoing set values with the <strong>Prevent extreme sets</strong> option. This allows the admin
        to
        specify an upper and
        lower bound for a point's values, such that an operator cannot set a value out to the device that is either
        below
        the <strong>Low set limit</strong>
        or above the <strong>High set limit</strong>.
    </p>
