        <li><strong>HTTP session timeout</strong> controls how long a user's session remains valid.
            If the user is inactive for longer than this period then their session cookie is invalidated.
            There is also a per-user setting that will override this value if configured for a user.
            You can configure advanced session cookie settings via your configuration file.
