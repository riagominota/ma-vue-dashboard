<p>
  This detector applies only to Numeric points. The <b>Low range limit</b> and <b>High range limit</b> define the range which the detector becomes 
  active. The detector may optionally be configured with a <b>Duration</b>, the point's value must stay within the
  range for at least the given duration before the detector becomes active. Events raised by this detector will 
  automatically return to normal when the condition is no longer satisfied. The range is inclusive of the limits, 
  meaning that if the value is exactly the low or high range limit the detector will fire an event.
