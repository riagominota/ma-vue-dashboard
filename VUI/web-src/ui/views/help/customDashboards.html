	<p>If you do not want to create pages within this app you can create your own copy of a dashboard.
	<strong>Note:</strong> there is much more work involved in creating a custom dashboard and we <strong>highly recommend</strong> using the <a ui-sref="ui.help.customPages">built in page system</a>.
	It is amazing what you will be able to build using just the Mango UI Components, Zero JavaScript, and the built in CMS!
	Using the built in CMS is the method we will be continuing to support and will evolve over time with even more features.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	You will need to work over <code>FTP</code> if Mango is live on a server or in a Code Editor if working on a local machine.
	The advantage is you can write your own JavaScript controllers and directives and extend our framework with your own <code>AngularJS</code> components.
	To create your own dashboard, copy one of the <a ui-sref="ui.examples.templates.angularMaterial">templates</a>
	into a new folder in <code>Mango/overrides/web/modules/mangoUI/web</code> and rename the HTML file to <code>index.html.</code></p>

	<p>There is also a complete <em>Material Design</em> <a ui-sref="ui.examples.templates.adminTemplate">admin template</a>
	similar to this web app, with a menu which you can customize using JavaScript.</p>

	<p>Once you have created a folder in overrides, your dashboard will be accessible at
	<a href="/user-ui/YOUR-FOLDER-NAME" target="_blank">/user-ui/YOUR-FOLDER-NAME</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		You will then need to update the loader script at the bottom of the index.html file.
		Replace <code>require(['mangoUIModule/adminTemplate/app']);</code> with <code>require(['mangoUIModule/YOUR-FOLDER-NAME/app']);.</code>
	</p>

	<p>Once you have a working template you can start playing around with the live
	examples and copy and paste them into your template HTML file.</p>
