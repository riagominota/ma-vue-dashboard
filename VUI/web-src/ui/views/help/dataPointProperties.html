        The <strong>Point name</strong> is required, and can be any text value. This name will be used as the visual identifier
        for the
        point throughout the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Often, the point name is supplemented with the <strong>Device name</strong> when it is shown in lists with other points.
        The
        two together are referred to as the "extended point name". The device name is initially defaulted to the data
        source
        name, but can be changed. The two together allow a point to be uniquely identified in an instance, especially
        in cases
        where there are multiple points with the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Export ID</strong> is required and can be any unique text value. A XID will be generated for you but this can
        be changed if you would like a discriptive XID.

        Point permissions are a comma-delimited list of virtual "group" names that are conferred the associated
        permission.
        <strong>Read permission</strong> allows the user to view the point various places, including the data point details page.
        <strong>Set permission</strong> allows the user to set the value of a settable point.
