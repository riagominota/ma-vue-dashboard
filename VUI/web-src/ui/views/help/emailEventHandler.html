    To add a mailing list to a list of recipients, select it from the list of add recipients and click. To add a user, 
    select a user from the Add user list and click. To add another address, enter it in the add address field and press <strong>Enter</strong>. 
    To delete any recipients from the list, click <strong>x</strong> button.
</p>

<p>
    To have escalation emails sent, select the Send escalation field, and enter Escalation recipients. The escalation email will only be 
    sent if the associated event is active for the period Escalate if active for
</p>

<p>
    An inactive notification event can be sent selected in the Send inactive notification field. If selected, notification will 
    be sent to all event receivers once the event has become inactive. Note that if an escalation email was not sent, inactive 
    notification will not be sent to the escalation list. Only those recipients who have received an active notification will 
    receive an inactive notification.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>Subject line</strong> can be configured to display the name of the event handler or the message for the event that 
    is generating the email.  The standard subject line looks like this:
    "AlarmLevel - name or event message (notification type) - id:event id" Where AlarmLevel is the level of the raised alarm (Critical, Urgent, ...), 
    the name or event message is defined by this setting, the notification type is (active, inactive, escalation) and the id part is the id of the event in the 
    database and is not present on Do Not Log level alarms.
</p>

<p>
  Including the system information is optional.  It will include a list of all Work Items currently scheduled in Mango.
  They are separated into 3 Groups, High, Medium and Low priority.  This is only included for diagnosing a 'sick' Mango.  It could be 
  problematic if your system has hundreds of thousands or millions of work items, so be aware when using this feature. 
</p>
<p>
  Including the logfile is optional and can be used to capture the <strong>full</strong> logfile at the moment of the event.  This is a zip attachment to the email.
</p>
<p>
  A <strong>Custom template</strong> can be provided to override the event active message sent by the email handler. The default templates
  can be found in MA_HOME/ftl/*/active.ftl (depends on system settings for email) and the include folders. The same object model is 
  passed to the custom template. Having an empty custom template means the default will be used. The textarea can be resized by
  dragging its corner. One can include other FTL files if they are on the loader path, which begins at MA_HOME/ftl/ . To replicate the 
  existing event template, you must add "html" or "text" in front of the include paths when setting the custom template.
</p>
<p>
  Points may be added as <strong>Additional context</strong> to appear in the model in the 'additionalContext' object using their <strong>template key</strong>.
  Additional context points have the following hash (object) fields:
</p>
<ul><li>templateKey - the identifier in the additional context hash (object)</li>
<li>name - the point's name</li>
<li>deviceName - the device name for the point</li>
<li>values - a sequence (list) of rendered point value times</li></ul>
<p>
  The event object is added to the model with the key 'evt'. Events have the properties on the evt object
  like those in the EventInstance class. Audit events have the JSON for the changes in question stored in their
  'context' attribute. Data source and data point events store the data source's object under 'evt.context.dataSource'.
  Publisher events have the publisher's object stored in 'evt.context.publisher'. System events have a null evt.context.
  If the event type is defined by a module, the contents of its context should be described in the help for that module. 
  See <a ui-sref="ui.help.freeMarkerTemplates">here for how to code templates</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The whole Map&lt;String, Object&gt; model map is passed into an optionally defined script. The script can manipulate the 'model'
  variable however it sees fit prior to the template being processed. The script can also prevent the sending of the email by doing a 
  "return CANCEL;" or a "return UNCHANGED;"  The permissions for the script allow restricting what it can access.

<h3>Script Permissions</h3>
<p>
  Script Permissions are used by any Script Utility to access Mango Points, 
  Publishers,Data Sources and any other items that require permission.  
</p>
<h3>Script Utilities That Use Permissions</h3>
<ul>
	<li>RuntimeManager</li>
	<li>DataSourceQuery</li>
	<li>DataPointQuery</li>
	<li>JsonEmportScriptUtility</li>
</ul>

<h3>Custom Email Templates</h3>

<p>
    Email templates are generated using FreeMarker <a href="https://freemarker.apache.org/">FreeMarker</a>. Mango can generate HTML or Plain text emails, this is configured 
    in the Email system settings area. Using the FreeMarker language one can customize the templates located at <code>MA_HOME/ftl</code>, if 
    you choose to customize an existing template be sure to place it into the <code>overrides/ftl/...</code> directory in the same folder structure as 
    the original. Further to the standard FreeMarker language there are 2 additional directives specific to Mango.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <code>&lt;@subject&gt;email subject content&lt;/@subject&gt;</code> - Defines the subject
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>&lt;@fmt message=translatable message OR key=i18n key/&gt;</code> - allows the use of Mango's i18n translations
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>
    The model is a map of data sent into the template that allows accessing Mango specific information during template generation. To use something 
    from the model, use ${modelKey} and/or ${modelKey.property}. For example every Email generated by and event handler will have an 'evt' property. 
    For example you can use ${evt.alarmLevel} to get the integer value of the alarm level. For example to Print Urgent one could use the following 
    ftl code:
</p>

<p>
    <code>&lt;#if evt.alarmLevel==0&gt; &lt;@fmt key="common.alarmLevel.urgent"/&gt; &lt; /#if&gt;</code>
</p>

<p>Another example of adding data point tags:</p>

<p><code>&lt;#list point.tags as tag,value&gt; ${tag} - ${value} &lt;/#list&gt;</code></p>

<p>
    Describing how to use all of the data within the model is not within the scope of this document, for examples please see the existing templates in the ftl folder.
