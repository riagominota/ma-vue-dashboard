	  Email settings are used for all emailing activities within the application instance.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  <strong>SMTP host</strong> is the name of the host where your MTA is running. If your host requires authentication, check the 
	  <strong>Use authorization</strong> box, and fill in the <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> fields. Check the <strong>Enable TLS</strong>
	  checkbox if your server requires it.
	</p>
	
	<p><strong>SMTP connection timeout</strong> is in milliseconds with 0 being no timeout.</p>
	
	<p>
	  The <strong>'From' address</strong> is the address that will be used as the from address on each email. The <strong>'From' name</strong> 
	  is an optional field with which to specify an alias&mdash;or 'personal' name&mdash;to display as the email sender.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  Use the <strong>Content type</strong> select box to choose the type of content you wish to have in the Mango emails. By default
	  <strong>HTML and text</strong> is selected, which causes Mango to create a multi-part MIME email with both "text/html" and 
	  "text/text" parts. If <strong>HTML only</strong> is chosen the email may still be a multi-part if there are attachments or 
	  in-line content, but will be otherwise be single part. If <strong>Text only</strong> is chosen, the email will always be a 
	  simple single part.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  When you are finished with your email settings, you can test them by clicking the Send Test Email 
	  button. This will attempt to send an email to your email address using the settings you have entered.
