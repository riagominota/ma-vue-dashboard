  <p>The <strong>Script</strong> area is where the script to execute is entered. Scripts can be any valid ECMAScript
    that would be written within a function.</p>

  <p>In addition to the ECMAScript context, globally-accessible functions can be defined, such as max(), min(), avg(),
    and sum(). (These functions are implemented in an modules such as SST Global Scripts.) To use them, simply call
    them from your script, for example:</p>
  <pre>return max(x.value, y.value, z.value);</pre>
  <p>This returns the maximum of the present values of 'x', 'y', and 'z'. Any number of parameters can be provided to
    any of these global functions.</p>
  <p>Once the script has been entered, click the Validate button to execute it and attempt to calculate the result.</p>

  <h2>Point Value Time Objects</h2>
  Mango stores its data in Point Value Time objects that contain a value and a time. When accessing internal
  data from Mango it is important to know if you are dealing with a raw value or a Point Value Time.
  <pre>
  {
    value: value of object,
    time: timestamp in milliseconds since epoch
  }
</pre>

  <h2>Time values</h2>
  <p>The timestamp of value is also available to the script.
    The following fields can be useful for conversions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>p.time - timestamp of the value in milliseconds since the epoch</li>
    <li>p.millis - 0-999 the millisecond portion of p.time</li>
    <li>p.second - 0-60</li>
    <li>p.minute - 0-60</li>
    <li>p.hour - 0-23</li>
    <li>p.day - 1-28,31</li>
    <li>p.dayOfWeek - 1-7 where 1 is Sunday</li>
    <li>p.dayOfYear - 1-365,366</li>
    <li>p.month - 1-12</li>
    <li>p.year - four digits</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Context objects</h2>
  <p>The script var that represents a point in a script is actually an 'object', in JavaScript terminology. An object
    is a container of values and functions that can be referenced by their property names. To get a description of the
    properties available for use in a script var, use the help property, e.g.:</p>
  <pre>return x.help;</pre>
  <p>This script works best if the data type is set to alphanumeric, but this is not required. The help property is
    identical to the toString() function, which is available on all context objects (i.e. not just script vars).</p>
  <p>The <strong>value</strong> property is the present value of the point. The JavaScript type of the value is
    analogous to its Mango type: Binary become boolean, Numeric becomes float, Multistate becomes integer, and
    Alphanumeric becomes string.</p>
  <p>Each script var also implements additional functions. The objects returned by these functions depend upon the data
    type of the point the var refers to. Again, the help property can be used to get a description of the returned
    object's properties. For the "periodType" parameter in all of the functions below, the following pre-defined global
    variables can be used: SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, WEEK, MONTH, and YEAR.</p>
  <p>The <strong>ago()</strong> function returns the value that the point had the given amount of time ago. For
    example, the call "x.ago(HOUR, 3)" returns the point's value exactly 3 hours ago without using the cache.</p>
  <p>The <strong>past()</strong> function returns an object containing statistics over the given period ending now. See
    below for a description of the various statistics objects.</p>
  <p>The <strong>prev()</strong> and <strong>previous()</strong> functions are identical; the latter is provided for
    its linguistic completeness. The functions return the same statistically object as past(), but over a different
    time span. The start and end times are quantized such that they correspond to the period type. For example, if the
    period type is HOURLY and periods is 1, and the function runs at 18:05, the time span that will be used is from
    17:00 (inclusive) to 18:00 (exclusive). If the periods were, say, 3, the time span would be from 15:00 to 18:00.
    Similarly, MONTH starts the time span at midnight on the first day of the previous month and ends it on the last
    day of the previous month (when periods is 1). Other period types work the same. A WEEK starts on Monday at
    midnight in accordance with ISO standards.</p>
  <p>
    The <strong>last(limit, cache)</strong> function return a list of the latest point value/time objects up to the
    given limit. The list will
    never be null, but could have a size from 0 to n depending on how many historical values there actually are. Values
    are sorted from most newest to oldest so that list.get(0) will return the most recent value. The list is a
    java.util.List object, and so has all of the methods available in that interface, including get(index) and size().
    The get(index) method will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you ask for an index that is >= the size, so
    be
    sure to check the list size before using get. Point value/time objects have "value" and "time" properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>lastValue(index, cache)</strong> function returns a single point value/time object, or null if the
    index is invalid. (Size checking
    in the list is done automatically, so an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException will never be thrown.) lastValue() and
    lastValue(0) will return the most recent logged value, lastValue(1, true) will return the second-most recent value
    (including cached values), etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>pointValuesBetween(from, to, cache)</strong> function return a list of point value/time objects between
    the given timestamps.
    The returned values are <strong>inclusive of the from time</strong> and <strong>exclusive of the end time</strong>.
    The list will never be null, but could have a size from 0 to n depending on how many historical values there
    actually are. Values
    are sorted in time order so that list.get(0) will return the oldest value. The list is a
    java.util.List object, and so has all of the methods available in that interface, including get(index) and size().
    The get(index) method will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you ask for an index that is >= the size, so
    be
    sure to check the list size before using get. Point value/time objects have "value" and "time" properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>pointValuesSince(timestamp, cache)</strong> function return a list of point value/time objects since
    the given timestamp.
    The returned values are <strong>inclusive of the timestamp</strong>.
    The list will never be null, but could have a size from 0 to n depending on how many historical values there
    actually are. Values
    are sorted in time order so that list.get(0) will return the oldest value. The list is a
    java.util.List object, and so has all of the methods available in that interface, including get(index) and size().
    The get(index) method will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if you ask for an index that is >= the size, so
    be
    sure to check the list size before using get. Point value/time objects have "value" and "time" properties.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>pointValueBefore(timestamp, cache)</strong> function returns the nearest point value/time object prior
    to timestamp, or null if there is not one.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>pointValueAfter(timestamp, cache)</strong> function returns the nearest point value/time object after
    to timestamp, or null if there is not one.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>pointValueAt(timestamp, cache)</strong> function returns the a point value/time object that was
    recorded exactly at the timestamp, or null if there is not one.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>set(value)</strong> function attempts to set the value to the context point through the point's data
    source (i.e. sending the set out to the device).
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>set(value, timestamp)</strong> function is the same as set(value) but with a timestamp for the new
    value supplied. Use new Date().getTime() to get the current time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <strong>set(value, timestamp, annotation)</strong> function is the same as set(value, timestamp) but also sets
    the annotation on the point value to the supplied annotation.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>Each script is executed with a set of permissions that are likely supplied when the item that will run the script
    was created. This is usually a script permissions setting
    but could simply the the permissions of the owner of the item. All non-admin users are restricted from executing
    Java code from within the script. The permissions are also
    used to ensure that all script utilities obey Mango permissions such as setting and viewing/querying for points.
  </p>

  <h2>Statistics objects</h2>
  <p>
    Statistics objects are returned from the past(PeriodType[, Periods][, cache]), prev(PeriodType[, Periods][,
    cache]), and
    previous(PeriodType[, Periods][, cache]), getStats(from, to[, cache]) functions. (See "Context objects" above.) The
    properties
    of the object returned depend upon the data type of point upon which they were generated. Time values in objects
    are stored as integers,
    but represent the number of milliseconds since midnight Jan 1, 1970.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Note 1:</strong> getStats(from, to) operates on timestamps, usage:</p>
  <pre>//Get the stats for the past 20 minutes
    var end = new Date();
    var start = new Date(end.getTime() - 1000 * 60 * 20); //20 min before now
    var stats = p1.getStats(start.getTime(), end.getTime());</pre>

  <p>
    The <strong>AnalogStatistics</strong> object is returned by Numeric points. It contains the following properties:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>minimumValue</strong>: (float) the minimum value the point reached over the period</li>
    <li><strong>minimumTime</strong>: (integer) the time at which the minimum value was reached</li>
    <li><strong>maximumValue</strong>: (float) the maximum value the point reached over the period</li>
    <li><strong>maximumTime</strong>: (integer) the time at which the maximum value was reached</li>
    <li><strong>average</strong>: (float) the average value of the point over the period</li>
    <li><strong>integral</strong>: (float) the integral value of the point over the period</li>
    <li><strong>sum</strong>: (float) the sum of all value updates over the period (appropriate for pulse counting)</li>
    <li><strong>startValue</strong>: (float) the value before or exactly at the period start time</li>
    <li><strong>firstValue</strong>: (float) the first value in the period</li>
    <li><strong>firstTime</strong>: (integer) the time of the first value</li>
    <li><strong>lastValue</strong>: (float) the last value in the period</li>
    <li><strong>lastTime</strong>: (integer) the time of the last value</li>
    <li><strong>count</strong>: (integer) the number of updates over the period</li>
    <li><strong>delta</strong>: (float) the change in value from startValue, or if null firstValue, to lastValue</li>
    <li><strong>periodStartTime</strong> (integer) the start time used for the calculation </li>
    <li><strong>periodEndTime</strong> (integer) the end time used for the calculation </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For example, the following returns the minimum value of 'n' over the past hour without considering cached values:
  </p>
  <pre>n.past(HOUR).minimumValue;</pre>
  <p>
    The <strong>StartsAndRuntimeList</strong> object is returned by Binary and Multistate points. It contains the
    following
    properties:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>periodStartTime</strong> (integer) the start time used for the calculation </li>
    <li><strong>periodEndTime</strong> (integer) the end time used for the calculation </li>
    <li><strong>count</strong> (integer) count of the total number of entries
    <li><strong>startValue</strong>: the value before or exactly at the period start time</li>
    <li><strong>firstValue</strong>: the first value in the period</li>
    <li><strong>firstTime</strong>: (integer) the time of the first value</li>
    <li><strong>lastValue</strong>: the last value in the period</li>
    <li><strong>lastTime</strong>: (integer) the time of the last value</li>
    <li><strong>data</strong>: (array) the list of individual StartAndRuntime objects.</li>
  </ul>
  Each StartsAndRuntime object has the following properties:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>value</strong>: (boolean for Binary, integer for Multistate) the point state to which the remaining
      properties apply</li>
    <li><strong>starts</strong>: (integer) the number of times the state was entered over the period</li>
    <li><strong>runtime</strong>: (integer) the amount of time in milliseconds the point was in the state over the
      period</li>
    <li><strong>proportion</strong>: (float) the proportion of the period the point was in the state (runtime / real
      duration)</li>
    <li><strong>percentage</strong>: (float) proportion * 100</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    To access a specific StartAndRuntime object in the list, you will first need to test to see if the state exists, as
    states that the point was not in during the period will not exist.
    For example, the following returns the proportion of time that 'b' was in state 'false' over the previous 2 months
    without considering the cache. Note
    that any states that have not occurred in this period will still return a StartsAndRuntime object from get() with 0
    starts, 0 runtime, and 0 proportion.
  </p>
  <pre>
    var stats = b.past(MONTH, 2);
    var sar = stats.get(false).proportion; //get the proportion of time in false whether or not false occurred
    var stateNotNull = stats.getStartsAndRuntime().containsKey(false); //see if false occurred
</pre>

  <p>
    The <strong>ValueChangeCounter</strong> object is returned by Alphanumeric points.
    It contains a property <strong>changes</strong>, which is the number of times the point changed during the period.
    For example, the following returns the number of times 'a' changed during the previous 45 minutes, including cached
    values.
  </p>
  <pre>b.previous(MINUTE, 45, true);</pre>
  Each ValueChangeCounter has the following properties:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>periodStartTime</strong> (integer) the start time used for the calculation </li>
    <li><strong>periodEndTime</strong> (integer) the end time used for the calculation </li>
    <li><strong>count</strong> (integer) count of the total number of entries</li>
    <li><strong>startValue</strong>: the value before or exactly at the period start time</li>
    <li><strong>firstValue</strong>: the first value in the period</li>
    <li><strong>firstTime</strong>: (integer) the time of the first value</li>
    <li><strong>lastValue</strong>: the last value in the period</li>
    <li><strong>lastTime</strong>: (integer) the time of the last value</li>
    <li><strong>changes</strong>: (integer) number of values not equal to the preceding value</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Note 2: </strong>
    startValue, firstValue, firstTime, lastValue, and lastTime can readily be null if there is no value before or
    especially in the period.
    Null values are cast by the JavaScript engine when used, typically to false or 0. When cast to a string, it will be
    "null" . Other statistics
    may have NaN, 0, or null values when there is no data in the period.
  </p>

  <h3>Cache Control</h3>
  <p>
    The cache argument can always be omitted to imply not using the point value cache. If using the cache, one may
    notice the cache may expand
    through use of the last and lastValue functions. Then new update will fill the cache even if the point is interval
    logging, which
    results in inconsistent data density if you then do a statistics calculation over the period of the cached values,
    which can lead
    to slightly different values than if you regenerated the point history after the fact.
  </p>

  <h2>Global Utilities</h2>
  The script context has some utilites that are globally available.
  <h3>DateTimeUtility</h3>

  <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
  This utility holds the timestamp of the runtime (not the time of the event that triggered it) and a few methods for
  computing period milliseconds.

  <h4>getRuntime()</h4>
  return - the runtime in milliseconds for this run of the script

  <h4>getTimestamp()</h4>
  return - the timestamp of the event that triggered execution

  <h4>millisInPast(periodType, count)</h4>

  count - the number of periods
  returns - the current runtime minus a count of periodType

  <h4>millisInPrev(periodType, count)</h4>
  periodType - integer corresponding with time period type, as defined in Common.TimePeriods
  count - the number of periods
  returns - the current runtime minus a count of periodType, bookended to the periodType.

  <h4>millisInPrevious(periodType, count)</h4>
  see millisInPrev(periodType, count)

  <h4>useRuntime()</h4>
  set CONTEXT to use the runtime to compute past and previous. This is the default.

  <h4>useTimestamp()</h4>
  set CONTEXT to use the timestamp to compute past and previous.

  <h4>setComputeTime(long)</h4>
  set the time to compute past and previous relative to.


  <h3>RuntimeManager</h3>
  This utility is accessible via RuntimeManager.{method}.
  The enable/disable methods return a status of:
  <ul>
    <li>-1 - Does Not Exist</li>
    <li>0 - No change in state</li>
    <li>1 - Operation successful</li>
  </ul>

  Available Methods:
  <hr>
  <h3>refreshDataPoint(xid)</h3>
  Refreshing a data point suggests to the Data Source that the point value should be collected ASAP. This will only
  happen if the underlying
  data source has implemented this functionality.

  xid - Xid for data point
  returns:
  <ul>
    <li>-1 - Point does not exist</li>
    <li>0 - Point is not enabled</li>
    <li>1 - Suggestion made to data source</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>refreshDataSource(xid)</h4>
  Refreshing a data source suggests to the Data Source that a regular poll should be collected ASAP. This will only
  happen if the underlying
  data source has implemented this functionality.

  xid - Xid for data soure
  returns:
  <ul>
    <li>-1 - Source does not exist</li>
    <li>0 - Source is not enabled</li>
    <li>1 - Suggestion made to data source</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>isDataSourceEnabled(xid)</h4>
  xid - Xid for a data source
  return true if enabled false if not or DNE

  <h4>enableDataSource(xid)</h4>
  xid - Xid for a data source
  return status

  <h4>disableDataSource(xid)</h4>
  xid - Xid for a data source
  return status

  <h4>isDataPointEnabled(xid)</h4>
  xid - Xid for a data point
  return true if enabled false if not or DNE or User does not have permissions
  <strong>Note: </strong> a disabled data point is a data point that is not collecting data, which can be due to either
  the point
  being disabled or its data source being disabled.

  <h4>enableDataPoint(xid)</h4>
  xid - Xid for a data point
  return status

  <h4>disableDataPoint(xid)</h4>
  xid - Xid for a data point
  return status

  <h4>sleep(milliseconds)</h4>
  milliseconds - the number of milliseconds to sleep for
  nothing returned

  <h3>Data Point Queries</h3>
  Data points can be queried by using the <strong>DataPointQuery</strong> utility. This utility has one method:
  <code>DataPointQuery.query(stringRql);</code>
  The RQL has a default limit of 100. Add
  <pre>'&amp;limit(-1)'</pre> to have no limit in the query.

  <h3>Data Source Queries</h3>
  <p>Data sources can be queried in much the same way. There is one method, <code>DataSourceQuery.query(stringRql);</code>
    A returned
    object will contain:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>name - String</li>
    <li>xid - String</li>
    <li>enabled - boolean</li>
    <li>type - String</li>
    <li>points - List&lt;DataPointWrapper&gt;</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>RQL</h4>
  <p>
    RQL is a query language that is highly flexible, more info <a href="https://github.com/persvr/rql" target="rql">here</a>.
    For example to find all points with a name that starts with Volts use this query:
    <code>like(name, Volts*)</code>
    Note the use of the asterisk wildcard, this is the default for all Mango RQL.
  </p>

  <h4>RQL Examples</h4>
  <p>This example will query for a set of the first 10 data points who's names contain the word 'boiler'
    and return an average their values. There is an additional check to ensure that only points that are enabled are
    used. Note that this could also be done in the RQL statement.</p>
  <pre>
var points = DataPointQuery.query('like(name, *boiler*)&amp;limit(10)');
var average = 0.0;

LOG.info('Found ' + points.size() + ' points to compute average.');

for(var i=0; i&lt;points.size(); i++){
  if(points.get(i).runtime !== null){
    LOG.info('Adding ' + points.get(i).runtime.value + ' to the average.');
    average = average + points.get(i).runtime.value;  
  }
}

return average/points.size();
</pre>

  <h3>DataPointWrapper</h3>
  <p>The DataPointWrapper returned has some of the basic information on a data point in addition to the
    Runtime member which is the same as the Object that wraps the context points for a script.
    The following are members of the DataPointWrapper Object: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>extendedName - String</li>
    <li>settable - Boolean</li>
    <li>deviceName - String</li>
    <li>enabled - Boolean</li>
    <li>xid - String</li>
    <li>name - String</li>
    <li>unit - String</li>
    <li>dataSourceName - String</li>
    <li>dataSourceXid - String</li>
    <li>runtime - Point Context object</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: The runtime is the object you would expect to see by adding a point to the script context. This is the
    object
    that contains the .ago(), .past() and .prev() methods as described above. Use caution as this member is null if the
    data point is not enabled.</p>

  <h3>Point Value Queries</h3>
  <p>While point values and statistics can be gotten through point wrappers, one need use the <code>PointValueQuery</code>
    utility
    to easily stream values or collate multiple points' values by time. A second method is provided to optionally roll
    the data up into
    rollup periods, and then to pass a part or the whole statistics object to the callback. To see the method
    signatures, run <code>print(PointValueQuery);</code>
    from within the scripting environment.</p>

  <h3>JsonEmport utility</h3>
  <p>The JsonEmport utility provides methods to pass JSON or get JSON as one would through an import/export page. A
    script cannot save itself
    through the emport utility. If it tried, that item in the JSON will be ignored. This utility is accessible through
    the context
    key "JsonEmport" and has the following functions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>getFullConfiguration(): String</li>
    <li>getConfiguration(String): String</li>
    <li>dataPointQuery(rql): String</li>
    <li>dataSourceQuery(rql): String</li>
    <li>doImport(String): void</li>
    <li>doImportGetStatus(String): List&lt;String&gt;</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>HttpBuilder</h3>
  <p>HTTP exchanges can be sent and handled from within the script body without using Java directly. The <strong>HttpBuilder</strong>
    object provides GET, POST, PUT and DELETE
    with synchronous callbacks. By default, responses with status 200 will be passed to the resp function if defined,
    other responses to the err function if defined, and
    local exceptions to the excp function if defined, or the err function if that is defined instead with status -1.
    Two forms of usage are supported:</p>
  <pre>
//First format, method chaining
print(HttpBuilder.get("http://localhost:8080/help.htm", {/* user supplied headers */}, {/* user supplied parameters */})
	.err(function(status, headers, content) { //setErrorCallback for linguistic completion
		throw "Request got bad response: " + status;
	}).resp(function(status, headers, content) { //setResponseCallback
		print(content);
		return true;
	}).excp(function(exception) { //setExceptionCallback
		throw exception.getMessage();
	}).execute()); //will print the help page then "true" if the resp function is executed. Otherwise will throw the error.
	
//Second format, full request
print(HttpBuilder.request({
	path: "http://localhost:8080/help.htm",
	method: "GET",
	headers: {},
	parameters: {},
	//content: "GETs don't have content!",
	err: function(status, headers, content) { //errorCallback for linguistic completion
		throw "Request got bad response: " + status;
	},
	resp: function(status, headers, content) { //responseCallback
		print(content);
		return true; //will print in wrapping print()
	}
	excp: function(exception) { //exceptionCallback
		throw exception.getMessage();
	}
}));
</pre>

  <h3>CONTEXT_POINTS</h3>
  <p>CONTEXT_POINTS is a variable declared in all scripting environments. It is a map of variable names to context
    point runtimes.</p>

  <h2>Logging</h2>
  <p>Logging can be achieved during script testing on the edit page by enabling the logging level desired and then
    using the appropriate log statement.</p>
  <pre>
LOG.trace('trace');
LOG.debug('debug');
LOG.info('info');
LOG.warn('warn');
LOG.error('error');
LOG.fatal('fatal');
</pre>
  <p>Additionally most test utilities will let you use the print() function to write out information while debugging a
    script in the test area</p>

  <h2>More Help</h2>
