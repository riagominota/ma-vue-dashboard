    <p>The Purge now functionality allows the easy purging of point values on an age basis. Values that are purged are
        permanently deleted and unrecoverable following this operation. Use the Purge data older than controls, or check
        Purge all data and press the Purge now button. Deletion is done asynchronously, so you may navigate away from this
        page or change other point properties, but by doing so you will not receive a purge completed confirmation.</p>
