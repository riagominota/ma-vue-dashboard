<p>
  This detector applies only to Numeric points. It uses an algorithm to calculate a smoothness metric on a stream of 
  values. The metric is specific to the stream of values, and will likely be different for each input source. Because 
  the calculated smoothness value at any point can be highly variable, it is often useful to apply a "boxcar" to a set
  of calculated values from which the average is derived. The <b>Low limit</b> is the value below which the detector 
  becomes active, and the <b>Boxcar size</b> is the length of calculated values over which the average is derived. The 
  detector may optionally be configured with a <b>Duration</b>; the smoothness must stay below the limit for at least 
  the given duration before the detector becomes active. Events raised by this detector will automatically return to 
  normal when the condition is no longer satisfied. NOTE: this detector is best used with points that update on a 
  regular schedule, such as every 5 minutes. Points that update irregularly may not perform well.
