<p>
    Mailing lists can be added to easily manage multiple email addresses at once. They can reference the email
    addresses of users as well as contain explicit (external) addresses. These lists can then be used a 
    recipients for messages sent by email event handlers.
</p>

<p>
    Use the <strong>New Mailing Lists</strong> button to create a new mailing list, or edit an existing list by clicking it's name in the list. 
    A mailing is thereafter referred to by it's name in other areas of the system.
</p>

<p>
    When editing a list, you can select users or explicit addresses (Note that changes to the user's 
    email address when editing a user will also update the mailing list).
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>Send alarm emails</strong> setting will cause the mailing list to receive generic alarm emails at or above that level 
    if the event occurs during an active time. No email handler is required. To prevent a mailing list from receiving 
    all alarms for a level, use either the Do Not Log or Ignore levels, which receive no emails based on level.
</p>

<p>
    In the <strong>Inactive schedule</strong> section, you can create select the time windows when you are unaivalable.
