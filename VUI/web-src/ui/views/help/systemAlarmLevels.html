    <p>
        System alarm levels can be explicitly set. Use the alarm level selection associated with the specific system
        event
        to determine what level events will have when they occur. Only events raised after saving the values will have
        the
        new alarm level. Save your settings by clicking the section's <img class="ma-ui-help ma-ui-help-button" src="./images/Help-Screenshots-WatchListSaveButton.png" />icon.
