<p>
    There is a watchdog service which periodically pings an API endpoint to check if the Mango API is up and if
    the user is logged in.
</p>

<p>
    The mangoWatchdog object is on the root scope, you can check <code>mangoWatchdog.apiUp</code> to see if the API is up
    and <code>mangoWatchdog.loggedIn</code> to see if the user is logged in. There is also a more detailed status string
    available at <code>mangoWatchdog.status</code>.
</p>

<p>
    See API Documentation for the <a ui-sref="ui.docs.ngMangoServices.maWatchdog"><code>mangoWatchdog</code></a> service.
