<p>
  An event detector's purpose is to determine if the value of a point satisfies one or more related conditions, and if 
  so, to become "active" and raise an event that can be appropriately handled. A point can have an unlimited number of 
  event detectors. The ways in which events can be detected depend upon the data type of point, and so only the event 
  detectors that apply to the current point's data type are listed in the <b>Type</b> selection.
</p>
<p>
  A point may have as many detectors as necessary, and can have multiple detectors of the same type. (i.e. multiple 
  high limit or low limit detectors.)
</p>
<p>
  To add a new detector select the <b>Type</b> from the list and give the event a name.  The event name will be used to 
  identify the event when assigning an event handler to the event. 
</p>
<p>
  Each detector type has an <b>Alarm level</b> attribute. This determines whether the detector raises an alarm when 
  active, and if so the severity of the alarm. See the general help page for information on Alarms.
