<p>The Rate Of Change detector only applies to Numeric points. This
	detector is able to raise events when the rate of change of the point
	crosses its rate of change threshold. The comparison option describes
	how the computed rate of change is compared to the rate of change
	threshold. An event will be raised whenever the comparison between the
	rate of change threshold and the computed rate of change is true.
</p>
<p>If the value is increasing or decreasing there will be a positive or negative 
	rate of change respectively.  Checking <b> Use absolute value </b> 
	ensures that the comparison is done to the absolute value of the computed rate of change.
	Meaning the event will trigger whether the values increase or decrease. 
</p>
<p>Checking <b>Use reset threshold </b> will allow you to configure a reset threshold.
    If the reset threshold is crossed, the event will return to normal.  If no reset threshold
    is configured then the event will stay active and only return to normal when the comparison 
    is no longer true.

<h2>RoC Computation Understanding</h2>
<p>
There are 3 values used to compute RoC.  Period start value which is the value at or before the period for which the RoC is computed, the latest value of the point (current value at time of computation) and the RoC Period Length.  The 2 modes determine these values differently but the computation is always the same:
</p>
<p>
If there is no period start value then we will not compute RoC.  If there is only a period start value then RoC is 0.  Otherwise:
</p>
<pre>
RoC = (Latest Value - Period Start Value)/RoC Period Length
</pre>
<p>
This results in a RoC per unit time.

The comparison then takes place:
 RoC [Comparison] Threshold = boolean value
</p>

<b>Instantaneous Mode</b>
<ul>
<li>Latest Value the current point value</li>
<li>Period Start Value the current value at or before the time the point starts, after this is always the previous point value to the latest value</li>
<li>RoC Period Length the time between samples</li>
</ul>
<p>
In this mode the RoC is computed only when a point value is set, at that time the latest value becomes the period start value and the latest value is the pointâ€™s current value (I.e. the one just set).  If 2 new values are set at the same timestamp then the RoC is assumed to be 0.
</p>
<b>Using a Duration</b>
<p>
Using a duration on an instantaneous detector could mean any size of change could appear in the period without raising an alarm, so long as no contiguous set of samples for the duration after an offending change all have an alarming rate of change. For instance, if a point was configured for greater than or equal to 10 per hour with a duration of at least 10 seconds, if at five seconds the value skyrockets several thousand, the timer for the duration would start. If it samples again and is still the same skyrocketed value, then the RoC is zero and the timer to raise the event about the change is cancelled. This setup should be thoroughly understood before used.
</p>

<b>Averaging Mode</b>
<ul>
<li>Latest Value the current point value</li>
<li>Period Start Value the value at or before the period start time.</li>
<li>RoC Period Length the length of the averaging period</li>
</ul>
<p>
The period slides at 2 potential times.  When a point value is set the period is computed to be the duration of the Averaging Period prior to but inclusive of the time of the latest point value set.  Second when time elapses such that there is new Period Start Value.
</p>

<b>Using a Duration</b>
<p>
Using a duration allows for delaying the event until the Comparison result has been true for some amount of time.  Once the threshold has been breached a timer is set that will be cancelled if a new value is set that does not cause an RoC breach before it expires and raises the event. This is the same with the averaging detector with a duration. Every time a new value is sampled, the rate of change is computed. If this computation does not result in an alarming rate of change, the timer to raise the event is cancelled. This means the point's value could change by an arbitrary amount and not raise the event 
</p>

 
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
If we wanted to detect if a point had changed by 10 or more within 30 minutes, we would use the following settings: threshhold = 20 per hour, averaging mode with an averaging period of 30 minutes, no duration, and a comparison of greater than or equal to
