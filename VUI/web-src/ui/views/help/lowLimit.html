  This detector applies only to Numeric points. The <b>Low limit</b> is the value that the detector uses as a boundary.  
  When the <b>State</b> is set to Less than the event becomes active when the value is below the limit, when set to Greater than or equal to 
  the event becomes active when the value is equal to or greater than the limit.  The optional <b>Reset Limit</b> is the value at 
  which the alarm will reset after it has been triggered. For a <b>State</b> of Less than the value must become greater than 
  or equal to the <b>Reset Limit</b>.  For a <b>State</b> of Greater than or equal to the value must become less than or equal to the <b>Reset Limit</b>.
  If not entered this value will be set to the  limit. If not entered this value will be set to the 
  limit.  The detector may optionally be configured with a <b>Duration</b>; the point's value must stay below the low 
  limit for at least the given duration before the detector becomes active. Events raised by this detector will 
  automatically return to normal when the condition is no longer satisfied.
