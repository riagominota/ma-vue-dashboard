<p>A <strong>Serial to socket bridge</strong> is a type of virtual serial port that allows Mango to transmit/receive serial data over a TCP/IP network.</p>

<h2>Serial client settings</h2>

<p>
    The bridge acts as a client that will connect to an open TCP/IP port on a host. The bridge will show up with 
    the <strong>Serial port id</strong> in the Comm port listings for applicable data sources. By setting the <strong>Serial port id</strong> and <strong>port</strong> Mango 
    will attempt to open up a TCP/IP socket and transmit data and receive messages. The <strong>timeout</strong> setting is referred 
    to as the SO_TIMEOUT and is the timeout in milliseconds that Mango will wait during read operations. The timeout 
    cannot be less than 0 and a timeout of 0 is interpreted as an infinite timeout.
</p>

<h2>Serial server settings</h2>

<p>
    The bridge acts as a server that will accept TCP/IP connections on the local host's port. The bridge will show up 
    with the <strong>Serial port id</strong> in the Comm port listings for applicable data sources. By setting the <strong>port</strong> Mango will attempt 
    to open up a TCP/IP server socket and wait for incoming connections. The timeout setting is referred to as the SO_TIMEOUT
     and is the timeout in milliseconds that Mango will wait during read operations. The <strong>timeout</strong> cannot be less than 0 and a 
     timeout of 0 is interpreted as an infinite timeout. The <strong>Buffer Size</strong> setting determines how much the socket will read before 
     transmitting onto the serial port.
