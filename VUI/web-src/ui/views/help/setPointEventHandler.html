<p>
    When an event is triggered, this handler will write the value at a given data point. The target is the data point that 
    will have its value changed. Optionally, the data point can be set with the value that changed the event, but this is only 
    possible if the event was triggered by a value changer, and the path data type is the same as the source data type. To set 
    the path to the source value, select the Use source value field. Or, enter the value you want to write in the Value to set field.
</p>

<p>
  It is also possible to use a script to compute the value to set to the target point. Set point scripts can have
  data points added into the context of the event, and the target point is always added under the key "target". If a
  point is disabled it will simply not be added to the context, so typeof(disabledVariableName) === "undefined"
