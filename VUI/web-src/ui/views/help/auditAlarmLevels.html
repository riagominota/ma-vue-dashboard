    Audit alarm levels can be explicitly set. Use the alarm level selection associated with the audit system event
    to determine what level events will have when they occur. Only events raised after saving the values will have the
    new alarm level. Save your settings by clicking the section's <img class="ma-ui-help ma-ui-help-button"  src="./images/Help-Screenshots-WatchListSaveButton.png"/> icon.
