<p>
  This detector applies only to Numeric points. The <b>Negative limit</b> is the CUSUM below which the detector becomes 
  active, and the <b>Weight</b> is the constant weight value to use for CUSUM calculation. The detector may optionally 
  be configured with a <b>Duration</b>; the CUSUM must stay below the limit for at least the given duration before the 
  detector becomes active. Events raised by this detector will automatically return to normal when the condition is no 
  longer satisfied.
