        <code>Users</code> represent individuals who use the system. Various privileges can be assigned to users to grant them
        the ability to read and alter data and system behaviour.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are two basic user levels: <code>Administrators</code>, and other users. <code>Administrators</code> have access
        to all system functionality. Other users have various privileges based upon permission configuration.

    <h2>Editing users</h2>

    <p>
        To add a new user, click the <code>New</code> button. The user will not actually be added until it is successfully
        saved. To edit an existing user, click the user's name in the <code>Users</code> list.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that on a narrow mobile view. The <code>Select user to edit</code> box will look slightly different, with a
        drop-down rather than a list and separate <code>Add User</code> button.
    </p>

    <p>
        Users may have alarm notification emails sent to their email addresses without explicitly being specified on an email
        event handler. Selecting a <code>Send alarm emails</code> alarm level other than <code>Ignore</code> will cause event
        notifications to be sent when the event's alarm level is greater than or equal this alarm level, but
        only when the event is raised (i.e. no escalation or inactive notifications). Note also that if the user is already
        specified on an email event handler, they will not be sent multiple emails.
    </p>

    <p>
        To delete a user, click the <code>Delete</code> button. To undo
        changes you have made to a User's settings click the <code>Revert</code> button to reset to the last saved state. To
        test a user's email address, click the <code>Send Test Email</code> button. This will cause an email to be sent to the
        specified email address. If you have a user selected other than the one you are logged in as you can click the
        <code>Switch To User</code> button to quickly log in as that user.

    <p>
        A <code>Muted</code> user will not hear the alarm sound go off for alarms.
        A <code>Disabled</code> user is not allowed to log in.
        Users may receive emails from their own audit trail by checking the <code>Receive own audit events.</code> Note that
        only audit events at or above the user's <code>Send alarm emails</code> setting will be emailed. Audit events would be
        emailed to all other users who have elected to receive event emails at or below the level of the event.

    <h2>User privileges</h2>

    <p>
        The Permissions group <code>superadmin</code> determines if a user is an <code>Administrator</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the user is not an administrator, the <code>Permissions</code> field determines what access to various areas of
        Mango the user has. The field contains a comma-delimited list of virtual "groups" to which the user belongs. If the
        user should have access to, for example, data source management, then at least one of the groups in the data source
        management permission list needs to match at least one of the groups in the user's list.
    </p>

    <p>
        Clicking on the drop-down will present a list of permission groups that other users have, but the current user does not.
        Clicking on a group name will add it to the current user's group list. The user must still be saved for the permissions
        to persist.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that the virtual group names are case-sensitive.
