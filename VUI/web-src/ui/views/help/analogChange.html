<p>
  This detector applies only to Numeric points. The <b>state</b> determines if the detector checks for increases, decreases or
  either change. The <b>limit</b> determines the amount the point can change. The <b>update event</b> stipulates if only logged values
  should be considered. Values within the <b>Duration</b> of now and the value of the point at the beginning of the checked period are used
  to assess if the event is active. If a point has one value 0 one hour ago and one value 1 now, and the change detector had a limit of 1,
  then it would be active regardless of the duration setting since at the point had value 0 when it got value 1.
