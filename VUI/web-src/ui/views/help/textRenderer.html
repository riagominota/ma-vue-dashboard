    <p>A text renderer's purpose is to convert a raw value into a form that is more recognizable and informative to a
        human user. The ways to render raw values depend upon the data type of value to be rendered. As such, only the
        renderer types that apply to the current point's data type are listed in the <strong>Type</strong> selection.</p>

    <h1>Binary</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Binary</strong> renderer allows the user to define a text label to represent each of the two binary states
        (i.e. 0 and 1). Any labels can be provided. Also, a distinctive color may be defined for each state. Typical
        examples of labels include off/on, stopped/running, or false/true, but any text can be entered.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Plain</strong> renderer is the default binary renderer. Displays the unaltered raw value, i.e. 0 and 1.</p>

    <h1>Numeric</h1>
    <p>
        The <strong>Analog</strong> renderer allows the user to define a <strong>Format</strong> used to determine things like the number
        of
        decimal places to display, and whether thousands should be delimited. (See the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/format/decimalFormat.html" target="_blank">Number formats</a> documentation).
        A
        <strong>Suffix</strong> can also be added to display the units of the value.
    </p>

    <p>The <strong>Plain</strong> renderer is the default numeric renderer. Displays the unaltered raw value.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Range</strong> renderer allows the user to define a number <strong>Format</strong> (see the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/format/decimalFormat.html" target="_blank">Number formats</a>
        documentation for more information), as well as an arbitrary number of textual values to represent various
        numeric from/to ranges. Each of these ranges can also be assigned a distinctive color. The number format is
        used if the value does not fall within a defined range or if you use the value interpolation feature.
        For example, the range "cold", "normal", and "hot" may be defined for a temperature point, with appropriate
        colors for each. If you insert the token <em>${value}</em> into your text the token will be replaced with
        the actual numeric value formatted according to the format field.</p>

    <p>
        The <strong>Time</strong> renderer allows the user to define a <strong>Format</strong> (see the "date/time format" documentation
        for more
        information). A typical date format would be "MMM d, yyyy". A typical time would be "HH:mm:ss". Date and time
        formats
        can be combined as necessary. A millisecond conversion exponent can also be defined. This is a power of 10
        exponent
        that will be used to convert a given value to the equivalent millisecond value. For example, to convert from
        seconds
        use 3, from microseconds use -3. If the value is already in milliseconds, use 0. Time values are assumed to
        start a 0
        on January 1, 1970 at midnight.
    </p>

    <h1>Multistate</h1>

    <p>The <strong>Plain</strong> renderer is the default multistate renderer. Displays the unaltered raw value.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Multistate</strong> renderer allows the user to define an arbitrary number of textual values to represent
        various point states. Each of these states can also be assigned a distinctive color. If a state occurs which is
        not assigned to a label, the raw value is displayed. Typical label sets include on/off/disabled, or
        off/warm/cool.</p>

    <h1>Alphanumeric</h1>

    <p>The <strong>Plain</strong> renderer is the only alphanumeric renderer. Displays the unaltered raw value, including an
        optional <strong>Suffix</strong>.</p>
